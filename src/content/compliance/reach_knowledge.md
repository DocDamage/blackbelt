# REACH Compliance Knowledge Base

This document contains key compliance information from the EU REACH regulation for the chatbot to reference.

## REACH Regulation Overview

REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) is the European Union regulation concerning chemicals and their safe use. It entered into force on June 1, 2007.

### Key Concepts

- **Registration**: Manufacturers/importers must register substances >1 tonne/year
- **Evaluation**: ECHA evaluates registration dossiers and testing proposals  
- **Authorisation**: Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC) may require authorization
- **Restriction**: Conditions/bans on manufacture, placing on market, or use

## Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC)

The SVHC Candidate List contains substances identified as having serious effects on human health or the environment. As of 2024, there are 235+ substances on this list.

### Categories of SVHC

1. **CMR** - Carcinogenic, Mutagenic, Reprotoxic (Categories 1A or 1B)
2. **PBT** - Persistent, Bioaccumulative, Toxic
3. **vPvB** - Very Persistent, Very Bioaccumulative
4. **Endocrine Disruptors** - Substances with hormone-disrupting properties
5. **Equivalent Concern** - Other substances causing serious effects

### Key SVHC Examples

| Substance | CAS Number | Reason for Inclusion |
|-----------|------------|---------------------|
| Lead | 7439-92-1 | Reprotoxic |
| Cadmium | 7440-43-9 | CMR |
| Dibutyl phthalate (DBP) | 84-74-2 | Reprotoxic |
| Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) | 117-81-7 | Reprotoxic |
| Hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) | 25637-99-4 | PBT |
| Bisphenol A (BPA) | 80-05-7 | Reprotoxic, Endocrine disruptor |
| 4,4'-Diaminodiphenylmethane (MDA) | 101-77-9 | Carcinogenic |
| Tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) | 115-96-8 | Reprotoxic |
| Anthracene | 120-12-7 | PBT |
| Cobalt dichloride | 7646-79-9 | Carcinogenic |

## Annex XIV - Authorization List

Substances on Annex XIV cannot be placed on the EU market or used after the sunset date unless authorized.

### Authorization Requirements

1. **Application**: Submit to ECHA showing no suitable alternatives
2. **Risk Assessment**: Demonstrate adequate control of risks
3. **Socio-Economic Analysis**: Justify benefits outweigh risks
4. **Substitution Plan**: Show efforts to find alternatives

### Key Authorized Substances

| Substance | Sunset Date | Uses Requiring Authorization |
|-----------|-------------|------------------------------|
| HBCD | 2019 | Expanded polystyrene for buildings |
| DEHP | 2015 | Various industrial uses |
| DBP | 2015 | Plasticizers |
| Chromium trioxide | 2017 | Surface treatment |
| Sodium dichromate | 2017 | Chromating |

## Annex XVII - Restrictions

Restrictions apply to substances that pose unacceptable risks. They can limit or ban:

- Manufacturing
- Placing on market  
- Use in products

### Key Restrictions

| Entry | Substance | Restriction |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| 23 | Cadmium | Banned in plastics, paints, metal plating |
| 27 | Nickel | Limited in jewelry, watch straps |
| 43 | Azocolourants | Banned in textiles |
| 46 | Nonylphenol | Limited in concentrations |
| 51 | Phthalates | Banned in toys >0.1% |
| 63 | Lead | Limited in jewelry, consumer products |
| 72 | CMR substances | Restricted in consumer products |

## Plastics Industry Compliance

### Key Concerns for Plastics

1. **Phthalate plasticizers** - Many are SVHC (DEHP, DBP, BBP, DIBP)
2. **Brominated flame retardants** - HBCD restricted
3. **Heavy metal stabilizers** - Lead, cadmium compounds restricted
4. **BPA in polycarbonates** - Endocrine disruptor concerns
5. **Microplastics** - New restriction proposals

### Compliance Steps for Plastics

1. **Map your supply chain** - Know all chemical inputs
2. **Check SVHC Candidate List** - Update quarterly
3. **Article 33 obligations** - Inform customers if SVHC >0.1%
4. **SCIP database** - Notify ECHA of SVHC in articles
5. **Alternative assessment** - Seek safer substitutes

## CLP Regulation

The Classification, Labelling and Packaging (CLP) Regulation implements the UN GHS in the EU.

### Hazard Classes

**Physical Hazards:**

- Explosives, Flammable gases/liquids/solids
- Oxidizing gases/liquids/solids
- Gases under pressure
- Corrosive to metals

**Health Hazards:**

- Acute toxicity (Categories 1-4)
- Skin corrosion/irritation
- Serious eye damage/irritation  
- Respiratory/skin sensitization
- Germ cell mutagenicity
- Carcinogenicity
- Reproductive toxicity
- STOT-SE, STOT-RE
- Aspiration hazard

**Environmental Hazards:**

- Aquatic acute/chronic toxicity
- Hazardous to ozone layer

### Signal Words

- **DANGER** - More severe hazards
- **WARNING** - Less severe hazards

### GHS Pictograms

| Symbol | Hazard |
|--------|--------|
| GHS01 | Explosive |
| GHS02 | Flammable |
| GHS03 | Oxidizing |
| GHS04 | Compressed gas |
| GHS05 | Corrosive |
| GHS06 | Acute toxicity |
| GHS07 | Harmful/irritant |
| GHS08 | Health hazard |
| GHS09 | Environmental hazard |
